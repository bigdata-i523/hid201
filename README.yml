        With the exponential increase in the number of connected IoT devices,
        the data generated by these devices has grown enormously. Sending this data
        to a centralized server or cloud results in enormous network traffic  and
        may lead to failures and increased latency. A solution for this problem is
        to do some processing on the devices closer to the network edge, enabling
        responsive and real-time analytics.  There have been various developments
        in the field of edge computing some of which are described here.
