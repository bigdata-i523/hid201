        With the exponential increase in the number of connected IoT devices,
        the data generated by these devices has grown enormously. Sending this data
        to a centralized server or cloud results in enormous network traffic  and
        may lead to failures and increased latency. A solution for this problem is
        to do some processing on the devices closer to the network edge, enabling
        responsive and real-time analytics.  There have been various developments
        in the field of edge computing some of which are described here.

        With the increse in the number of edge devices and their applications in 
        settings like sensor networks, it is crucial to allow communication between
        the sensing devices and actuators, which may not be directly connectes. 
        To allow services built on various different platforms and using different 
        hardware to commmunicate , a data agnostic, fast and reliable mechanism is 
        needed to allow communication between these devices. In addiion to communication,
        the data generated by these devices must be analyzed and security of this data is
        highly important. MQTT is a common, easy to use, queing protocol that helps meet 
        these requirements.

        As the number of connected edge devices increases there is a need for fast 
        comunication between these devices, and to analyse the data collected by
        these devices, which is made possible by the use of a scalable lightweight 
        communicatoin protocol such as MQTT, which is easy to use, data agnostic, and 
        application independent.
        We look at one such appllication of the protocol, to control a robot car remotely,
        over wireless network, navigating with the help of a raspberry pi camera on the car.
