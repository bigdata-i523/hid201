# Big Data Analytics and Edge Computing

## Abstract
With the exponential increase in the number of connected IoT devices, the data generated by these devices has grown enormously. Sending this data to a centralized server or cloud results in enormous network traffic and may lead to failures and increased latency. A solution for this problem is to do some processing on the devices closer to the network edge, enabling responsive and real-time analytics. There have been various developments in the field of edge computing some of which are described here.
