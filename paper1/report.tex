\begin{abstract}
With the exponential increase in the number of connected IoT devices, the data generated by these devices has grown enormously. Sending this data to a centralized server or cloud results in enormous network traffic and may lead to failures and increased latency. One solution of this problem is to do some processing on the edge devices. This is extremely helpful in providing responsive and real time analytics.

\section{Introduction}

With the rapid increase in the acceptanceof Internet of Things (IoT) devices across various fields in the world, ranging from industrial sensors to lifestyle and sports products, and the consequent increase in the data generated by such devices, there is a pressing demand for devices and processes that can analyze this data and provide responsive analytics.\cite{ieee_iot_cloud_analytics_newsletter}. With increase in the number of sucn devices, it gets increasingly dificult to perform  all analytics on a server in a traditional manner. Thus, more recent approaches aim to push a part of this computation closer to the end user of the device, or closer to the edge.
